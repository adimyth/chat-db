# Chat DB

## _Query your database the way you talk_

### What is Chat DB?

Chat DB is a revolutionary new way of querying your databases using natural language. With Chat DB, you can easily communicate with your database by simply typing out your queries in the same way you would talk to a human. No more struggling with complicated SQL syntax - with Chat DB, you can get the information you need in seconds.

### How does it work?

Chat DB is incredibly easy to use. Simply sign up and connect your Postgres or MySQL database, and you're ready to start querying. Once you're connected, you can create multiple chat sessions, each one displaying a list of tables against which you can query and converse. You can even save your sessions, so you can pick up right where you left off.
